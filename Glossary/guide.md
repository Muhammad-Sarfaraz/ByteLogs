# â€‹Glossary

- **abstract superclass** - a class which must have subclasses in order to be instantiated.
- **Adapter pattern** - a design pattern that connects two incompatible interfaces by fitting between them and providing a compatible interface to both.
- **Agile development** - a family of software development methodologies that encourage adaptivity, cross-functional collaboration, evolutionary development, early delivery, and continuous improvement.
- **Anti-Pattern** - a commonly-encountered attempted solution to a problem which is counterproductive or ineffective.
- **behavioural patterns** - design patterns that focus on how objects distribute work.
- **boundary object** - an object which interfaces with objects outside the current system or with users.
- **Chain of Responsibility pattern** - a behavioural pattern for allowing multiple entities to handle requests.
- **code reuse** - using existing code to build new software.
- **code smell** - a symptom of bad code.
- **Command pattern** - a behavioural pattern for encapsulating requests as objects.
- **comments** - annotations to code that clarify its purpose. Can be considered a code smell if overused to compensate for a lack of clarity in the code.
- **Composing objects principle** - an alternative method of code reuse that uses aggregation rather than inheritance.
- **composite class** - a class which is designed to contain other classes, including objects of the same type.
- **Composite pattern** - a design pattern for composing nested structures of objects and dealing with these objects uniformly.
- **concrete instantiation** - the act of instantiating a class (usually with the `new` operator in Java).
- **control object** - generally, an object whose role is to coordinate the actions of other objects.
- **Controller** - coordinates the functions of the model and view components. A control object.
- **creational patterns** - design patterns that involve instantiating concrete objects.
- **data class** - a code smell/anti-pattern; a very small class with little more than data.
- **data clump** - a code smell/anti-pattern; a group of frequently-associated data that would be better encapsulated as an object.
- **Decorator pattern** - a design pattern allowing for added behaviour through wrapping.
- **design pattern** - a general solution to a commonly occurring problem in software design. Not characterized by specific code, but rather, best practices for common issues.
- **Dependency Inversion principle** - a design principle striving for high-level dependencies based on abstract superclasses.
- **divergent change** - a code smell/anti-pattern; developers find themselves changing a class in different, often contradictory ways. Indicates poor separation of concerns.
- **duplicated code** - a code smell/anti-pattern; the same code, sometimes with small changes, is found in multiple places in the software.
- **entity object** - an object that encapsulates what the software is interested in representing. Usually provides methods for interacting with the data therein.
- **Facade pattern** - a design pattern that involves encapsulating a complex system in a simple interface.
- **Factory Method pattern** - a pattern that delegates concrete instantiation to a method of a subclass.
- **Factory Object** - any object whose main purpose is concrete instantiation.
- **feature envy** - a code smell/anti-pattern; two classes that would be better together, usually indicated by frequently invoking each other's methods.
- **Gang of Four** - the four co-authors of the textbook: *Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software*.
- **generalization** - a design principle dictating that behaviour should be generalized where possible.
- **inappropriate intimacy** - a code smell/anti-pattern; two classes that should have a further degree of separation.
- **information hiding** - a design principle dictating that information not essential outside a class should be hidden from other classes.
- **inheritance** - when a subtype or subclass inherits behaviours and methods from the supertype or superclass.
- **Interface Segregation principle** - a design principle that recommends having smaller, more specific interfaces.
- **large class** - a code smell/anti-pattern; a class is very large. Indicates need for better separation of concerns.
- **lazy creation/lazy initialization** - instantiating an object when it is needed rather than at startup, improving boot time.
- **leaf class** - a class that cannot or should not be subtyped. Can be enforced with the `final` keyword in Java.
- **long method** - a code smell/anti-pattern; a method is very large. Indicates need for better separation of concerns.
- **long parameter list** - a code smell/anti-pattern; a method has a long list of parameters. Can be improved by parameter objects.
- **Mediator pattern** - a behavioural pattern in which a central object coordinates the activities of many objects.
- **message chains** - a code smell/anti-pattern; a chain of object returns and method calls is strung together. A violation of the principle of least knowledge.
- **MVC pattern** - stands for Model, View, Controller. A pattern that separates data, display, and control functions.
- **Model** - the data or "backend" component of the MVC pattern. An entity object.
- **Observer pattern** - a behavioural pattern for event handling.
- **Open/Closed principle** - a design principle dictating that an object should be open to extension but closed to modification.
- **pattern language** - a method of describing good design practices or patterns in a field of expertise.
- **polymorphism** - the ability to interact with objects of different types in the same way.
- **primitive obsession** - a code smell/anti-pattern; inappropriate or extensive use of primitive data types.
- **principle of least knowledge** - a design principle stating that classes should interact with as few other classes as possible.
- **Refactoring** - the process of changing code so that external behaviours and interfaces remain unchanged but internal structure is improved.
- **refused bequest** - a code smell; subclasses are inheriting methods they do not need.
- **Separation of concerns** - a design principle dictating that different functions should be in separate objects or processes.
- **shotgun surgery** - a change in one place that necessitates many other changes; a symptom of tight coupling.
- **Singleton pattern** - a design pattern that enforces a single instantiation of a class globally accessible.
- **speculative generality** - a code smell/anti-pattern; defining a superclass or interface before it is needed.
- **State pattern** - a behavioural pattern for handling requests taking into account the current state of the object.
- **structural patterns** - design patterns that describe how objects are connected to one another.
- **subclass** - a class that inherits from a parent class, called a superclass.
- **subtype** - a data type that inherits from a parent type, called a supertype.
- **switch statements** - a code smell/anti-pattern; using switch statements where polymorphism is better.
- **Template Method pattern** - a behavioural pattern that allows for similar behaviour to be inherited by multiple subclasses.
- **View** - the display or user-interface component of the MVC pattern. A boundary object.
