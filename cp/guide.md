# Competitive Programming

### Problem Solving Strategies
The two main problem-solving strategies are backward reasoning (goal reduction) and forward reasoning, also known as top-down and bottom-up reasoning, respectively.

#### Time-complexity
Time complexity is a way to express how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases.

* O(1): Constant time complexity. The algorithm's running time does not depend on the input size.

* O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity. Common in algorithms that divide the problem into smaller subproblems in each step.

* O(n): Linear time complexity. The running time grows linearly with the input size.

* O(n^2): Quadratic time complexity. Common in algorithms with nested loops.

* O(2^n): Exponential time complexity. The running time doubles with each increase in the input size, often seen in inefficient recursive algorithms

#### Tips
- If you find a problem is good and can be applied many times. You can do it 3 times
  - First time is for understanding problem + editorial
  - Second time is for doing it + high-ranker's code
  - Third time is for doing faster + search for more problems similiar to it
