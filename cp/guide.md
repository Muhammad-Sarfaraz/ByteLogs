#### Time-complexity
Time complexity is a way to express how the running time of an algorithm grows as the size of the input increases.

* O(1): Constant time complexity. The algorithm's running time does not depend on the input size.

* O(log n): Logarithmic time complexity. Common in algorithms that divide the problem into smaller subproblems in each step.

* O(n): Linear time complexity. The running time grows linearly with the input size.

* O(n^2): Quadratic time complexity. Common in algorithms with nested loops.

* O(2^n): Exponential time complexity. The running time doubles with each increase in the input size, often seen in inefficient recursive algorithms
