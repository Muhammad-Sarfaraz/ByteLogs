# Controlling Networkflows
- Rate Limiting: It involves setting a maximum limit on the number of requests or actions allowed within a specific timeframe. 
This helps in preventing abuse of resources, such as API endpoints, by limiting the rate at which clients can make requests.

- Throttling: Throttling, on the other hand, involves regulating the rate of data transmission or processing to ensure that 
it remains within predefined limits. This is often used to prevent server overload or to prioritize certain types of traffic over others during periods of high demand
