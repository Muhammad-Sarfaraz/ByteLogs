### Squad Identity Model (Team Identity model | Agile Squad Model)

The Squad Identity Model is a framework for creating distinct, autonomous, and highly motivated teams (or “squads”) within a larger organization. Each squad develops its own:

- Name – gives a sense of belonging and brand inside the company.
- Philosophy / Motto – reflects shared values and working principles.
- Goals & Metrics – clear outcomes they are accountable for.
- Recognition & Bonding Rituals – ways to celebrate achievements and reinforce team culture.

Purpose:

- Builds team cohesion and morale.
- Encourages accountability and ownership.
- Enhances visibility of contributions and skills.
- Supports a scalable, structured approach to team management.


## 1. Squad Overview
| Squad Name       | TPM Lead  | Members Count | Squad Philosophy / Motto             |
|-----------------|-----------|---------------|------------------------------------|
| Alpha Coders     | TPM A     | 20            | "Ship fast, learn faster"           |
| Pixel Pioneers   | TPM B     | 20            | "Design with purpose"               |
| Data Dynamos     | TPM C     | 20            | "Data first, always"                |

### Weekly Alignment Framwork

**CTO:** What are this week’s deliverables, and what has been delivered? Are we on track?

**TPM:** Every week, they report to the CTO with completed items and planned deliverables. What is done this week, and what remains?

**BA / Dev:** Focus on completing and delivering the planned items on time.

### What is What: Delivered vs Deliverable

**Deliverable:** This is what we are supposed to produce. It’s a planned output in the project scope. Think of it as the goal or item we need to finish.

**Examples:**
- A web app feature
- An API endpoint
- A module, script, or report
- Technical documentation

**Delivered:** This is what we have actually completed and handed over. It’s the done version of a deliverable.

**Examples:**
- “The payment API was delivered last week.”
- “The new dashboard module has been delivered to QA.”

**Simple way to remember:**
- Deliverable = planned output
- Delivered = finished output

### Cost Plus Pricing Model

The Cost-Plus Pricing Model is a pricing strategy where a fixed percentage (markup) is added to the total cost of producing a product or delivering a service. This ensures all costs are covered and a profit is made.

**Total Cost = Direct Costs + Indirect Costs**

**Example:**
Our company is building a website for a client called Project X. The developer team says it will take 100 hours to make the website.

The company adds:
- 100 hours for the developers (real work)
- 50 hours for buffer — in case something goes wrong or changes are needed
- 100 hours for company profit

So the company tells the client the website will cost 250 hours in total.

**Inside the company:**
- The dev team knows it’s a 100-hour job.
- The project manager (TPM) plans for 150 hours (work + buffer).
- The CTO or owner sees 250 hours (total billed).

If the developers finish on time (in 100 hours), the company earns 150 hours worth of profit.

This idea is called cost-plus pricing — you take your cost (100), add a bit more for safety (50), and then add profit (100).

### RACI Matrix (Responsibility Assignment Matrix)

The RACI model helps clarify roles and responsibilities in a project. It ensures everyone knows who is doing what, who approves, and who is just informed.

**Example Chart:**

| Task / Activity   | Responsible (R) | Accountable (A) | Consulted (C) | Informed (I) |
|-----------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Design Mockup   | Designer       | Project Lead   | UX Team       | Stakeholders |
| Code Review     | Developer      | Tech Lead      | QA Team       | Project Lead |
| Client Signoff  | Project Lead   | Client Manager | Team Leads    | All Team     |

**Meaning of RACI letters:**
- R – Responsible: Person(s) doing the work.
- A – Accountable: Person who owns the task, approves, and ensures it’s done.
- C – Consulted: People whose opinions are needed; two-way communication.
- I – Informed: People who need to be kept up-to-date; one-way communication.
