## Leading & Management

#### RACI Matrix (Responsibility Assignment Matrix)
The RACI model helps clarify roles and responsibilities in a project. It ensures everyone knows who is doing what, who approves, and who is just informed.

Example Chart:
| Task / Activity        | Responsible (R) | Accountable (A) | Consulted (C) | Informed (I) |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Design Mockup          | Designer       | Project Lead    | UX Team       | Stakeholders |
| Code Review            | Developer      | Tech Lead       | QA Team       | Project Lead |
| Client Signoff         | Project Lead   | Client Manager  | Team Leads    | All Team     |

Meaning of RACI letters:
R – Responsible: Person(s) doing the work.
A – Accountable: Person who owns the task, approves, and ensures it’s done.
C – Consulted: People whose opinions are needed; two-way communication.
I – Informed: People who need to be kept up-to-date; one-way communication.
