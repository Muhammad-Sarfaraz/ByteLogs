## Leading & Management

#### Cost Plus Pricing Model
The Cost-Plus Pricing Model is a pricing strategy where a fixed percentage (markup) is added to the total cost of producing a product or delivering a service. This ensures all costs are covered and a profit is made.

Total Cost = Direct Costs + Indirect Costs

for example Our company is building a website for a client called Project X.
The developer team says it will take 100 hours to make the website.

The company adds:
100 hours for the developers (real work)
50 hours for buffer — in case something goes wrong or changes are needed
100 hours for company profit

So the company tells the client the website will cost 250 hours in total.

Inside the company:
The dev team knows it’s a 100-hour job.
The project manager (TPM) plans for 150 hours (work + buffer).
The CTO or owner sees 250 hours (total billed).

If the developers finish on time (in 100 hours),
the company earns 150 hours worth of profit.

This idea is called cost-plus pricing —
you take your cost (100), add a bit more for safety (50),
and then add profit (100).


#### RACI Matrix (Responsibility Assignment Matrix)
The RACI model helps clarify roles and responsibilities in a project. It ensures everyone knows who is doing what, who approves, and who is just informed.

Example Chart:
| Task / Activity        | Responsible (R) | Accountable (A) | Consulted (C) | Informed (I) |
|------------------------|----------------|----------------|---------------|--------------|
| Design Mockup          | Designer       | Project Lead    | UX Team       | Stakeholders |
| Code Review            | Developer      | Tech Lead       | QA Team       | Project Lead |
| Client Signoff         | Project Lead   | Client Manager  | Team Leads    | All Team     |

Meaning of RACI letters:
R – Responsible: Person(s) doing the work.
A – Accountable: Person who owns the task, approves, and ensures it’s done.
C – Consulted: People whose opinions are needed; two-way communication.
I – Informed: People who need to be kept up-to-date; one-way communication.
