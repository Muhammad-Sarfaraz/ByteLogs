# Operating System

27 May 2024 - 31 May 2024

- Study point of views about operating systems
- Linux, Open source and free software
- History: Minix and others operating systems
- PC startup sequence, kernel, service levels and bootloaders
- Kernel Types: Monolytic, Microkernel, hybrid, modular,
  - Power On → POST → BIOS/UEFI → Bootloader (like GRUB or Windows Boot Manager).
Bootloader → Load Kernel → Kernel Manages System Resources.
Kernel Initializes System → Runlevel is Set (determines the services to start).
System Ready for User Interaction.

- Unikernel, Exokernel
  - Exokernel: Definition: A minimalistic kernel that gives applications direct access to hardware resources, avoiding abstraction layers.
Key Points: Highly flexible, allows applications to manage resources directly for maximum performance.
  - Unikernel: Definition: A minimalistic, single-purpose operating system that combines only the necessary parts of the OS with the application into one executable, running directly on hardware or a hypervisor.
Key Points: Highly efficient, secure, and optimized for specific applications.
